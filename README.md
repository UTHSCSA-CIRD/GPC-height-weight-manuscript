IRB study protocol & aims, IRB deferral process
-----------------------------------------------

The overall purpose of the Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC) Healthy Weight Study (HWS) was to conduct a demonstration survey across the 12 participating GPC sites focused on the topic of pediatric obesity. More specifically, the aims were to: 1) estimate the willingness of individuals to be contacted about research activities; 2) obtain information on the attitudes of parents and adults of child bearing age about research, including participation of their child/ren; 3) gain insight into participant attitudes about the use of gathered data for both local and national research; 4) explore the impact of various demographic factors, survey methods, regional variation, and weight status on the above questions. An additional expected outcome of the project was to establish and explore the various practicalities and functionalities of a large semi-interconnected system such as the GPC for conducting collaborative research focused on pediatric obesity.

Although previous studies have been published on adult obesity using a PCORI funded CDRN (Young et al, 2016), these studies were retrospective in nature reporting on the number of patients in the network who met certain criteria. In contrast, the GPC HWS not only gathered retrospective data on individuals who met certain specific inclusion criteria but also contacted a random group of individuals from this sub-sample at each site with a survey invitation. The goal for of the 12 participating sites was to collect 1000 responses to “Survey 1” and 100 responses to “Survey 2.” Survey 1 was a single question asking whether or not the individual contact was willing to be contacted for research, and survey 2 was a more detailed assessment (see Table 1).

Across the GPC a central IRB process was developed (asked Russ for reference on this – not in his paper). This involved a legal agreement between all sites designating the University of Kansas Medical Center as the lead IRB for the GPC, with all other sites agreeing to “rely” on this central IRB. For the healthy weight study this central IRB process was utilized. However, the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) served as the central IRB site for the healthy weight study across the GPC network. A team of investigators and staff developed the necessary IRB documents which were submitted to the IRB at UTHSCSA. Once the documents were reviewed and approved by this single IRB, the documents were shared with all other participating site’s IRBs, and these documents were approved without additional edits under the existing overall IRB reliance agreement.

Natural experiment – variation in patient contacting methods
------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals who were sent the survey invitation were contacted via a variety of means, including snail mail, email, and through the patient portal systems in the site’s electronic medical record (EMR). The method of contact was selected by the site as that which would encounter the fewest barriers and result in the greatest sample. Allowing each site to select their own contact method allowed for a naturalistic experiment of response rates and other factors by method of contact. For a detailed list of site and contact method see Table 2.
